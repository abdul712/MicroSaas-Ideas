# Business Expense Splitter - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
Business partners, co-founders, and teams sharing expenses face complex calculations, disputes, and time-consuming reconciliation processes. Traditional methods using spreadsheets lead to errors, lack transparency, and strain business relationships. This becomes especially problematic with varying ownership percentages, different expense categories, and international transactions.

### Solution
A specialized expense splitting platform designed for business partnerships that automatically tracks, categorizes, and splits shared expenses according to predefined rules. The system provides real-time visibility, handles complex splitting scenarios, and integrates with business banking to automate reconciliation and settlements.

### Target Audience
- Business partners and co-founders
- Real estate investment partnerships
- Shared office/coworking spaces
- Joint ventures and project collaborations
- Professional service partnerships (law firms, medical practices)
- Franchise co-owners

### Value Proposition
"End business expense disputes forever - automatically split costs based on your partnership agreement, track who owes what in real-time, and settle up with one click while maintaining complete transparency and audit trails for tax purposes."
