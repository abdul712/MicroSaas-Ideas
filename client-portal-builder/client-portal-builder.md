# Client Portal Builder - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
Service businesses and agencies struggle to share files, project updates, and communicate with clients professionally. They resort to insecure email attachments, confusing folder structures, or expensive enterprise solutions. Clients get frustrated with scattered information and lack of transparency, while businesses waste time on back-and-forth communications.

### Solution
A no-code platform to create branded, secure client portals where businesses can share files, project updates, invoices, and communicate with clients in one organized space. Each client gets their own password-protected portal with a professional appearance that matches the business's brand.

### Target Audience
- Digital agencies and consultants
- Law firms and legal services
- Accounting and financial advisors
- Real estate agents and brokers
- Freelancers and creative professionals
- Construction and contractors
- Healthcare providers
- Educational consultants

### Value Proposition
"Give your clients a professional home for everything they need. Create secure, branded portals in minutes where clients can access files, track projects, and communicate with you. No coding required, impressive results guaranteed."
