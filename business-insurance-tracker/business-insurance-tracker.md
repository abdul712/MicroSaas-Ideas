# Business Insurance Tracker - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
Businesses typically manage multiple insurance policies across different providers, each with varying renewal dates, coverage limits, and premium schedules. Missing renewal dates can leave businesses exposed to liability, while poor policy management leads to coverage gaps, overpayment, and compliance issues. Many businesses rely on spreadsheets or paper files, making it difficult to optimize coverage and costs.

### Solution
A comprehensive Business Insurance Tracker that centralizes all insurance policies, automates renewal reminders, tracks claims, and provides insights into coverage optimization. The platform helps businesses maintain continuous coverage, reduce costs through competitive quotes, and ensure compliance with industry requirements.

### Target Audience
- Small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs)
- Risk managers and CFOs
- Insurance brokers managing multiple clients
- Property management companies
- Construction and contracting firms
- Healthcare practices

### Value Proposition
"Never miss an insurance renewal again. Manage all your business policies in one place, get alerts 60 days before renewals, compare quotes instantly, and ensure you're never underinsured or overpaying. Reduce insurance costs by up to 25% through better policy management."
