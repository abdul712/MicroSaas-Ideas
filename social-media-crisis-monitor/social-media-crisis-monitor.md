# Social Media Crisis Monitor - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem
Brands can face reputation crises within hours on social media. By the time they notice negative mentions, the damage is often already done. Manual monitoring is impossible across all platforms, and existing enterprise tools are expensive and complex.

### Solution
An AI-powered monitoring system that tracks brand mentions across social platforms, identifies negative sentiment in real-time, and alerts teams instantly when potential crises emerge, enabling rapid response before issues escalate.

### Target Audience
- Small to medium businesses
- E-commerce brands
- Restaurants and hospitality
- Healthcare practices
- Personal brands and influencers
- PR agencies

### Value Proposition
"Know about brand crises before they explode. Real-time alerts when your reputation is at risk."
