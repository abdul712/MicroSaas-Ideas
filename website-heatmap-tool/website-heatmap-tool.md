# Website Heatmap Tool - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem
Small business owners and marketers struggle to understand how visitors interact with their websites. Without visual insights into user behavior, they make design decisions based on assumptions rather than data, leading to poor conversion rates and missed opportunities.

### Solution
A simple, affordable heatmap tool that visually shows where users click, scroll, and move their mouse on websites. The tool provides easy-to-understand visual data without the complexity and high costs of enterprise analytics solutions.

### Target Audience
- Small business owners with websites
- Freelance web designers and developers
- Digital marketing agencies serving SMBs
- E-commerce store owners
- Bloggers and content creators

### Value Proposition
"See exactly how visitors use your website in minutes, not hours. Our simple heatmap tool helps you make data-driven decisions to improve conversions without breaking the bank or needing a data science degree."
