# Appointment Booking Widget - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
Service-based businesses lose potential customers due to friction in the booking process. Traditional methods like phone calls and email exchanges are inefficient, lead to double bookings, and create poor customer experiences. Existing booking solutions are often expensive, complex, or require customers to leave the business's website.

### Solution
An embeddable appointment booking widget that seamlessly integrates into any website, allowing customers to book appointments 24/7 without leaving the site. The solution focuses on simplicity, customization, and powerful features like automated reminders, payment collection, and calendar synchronization.

### Target Audience
- Healthcare providers (doctors, dentists, therapists)
- Beauty and wellness (salons, spas, fitness trainers)
- Professional services (consultants, lawyers, accountants)
- Home services (plumbers, electricians, cleaners)
- Educational services (tutors, coaches, instructors)
- Freelancers and solopreneurs
- Small appointment-based businesses

### Value Proposition
"Never miss another booking. Add a beautiful, customizable booking widget to your website in minutes. Let customers book appointments 24/7 while you focus on delivering great service. No coding required."
