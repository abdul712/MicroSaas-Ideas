# Content Calendar Planner - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem
Content creators and marketing teams struggle with planning and organizing content across multiple platforms. They use disconnected tools like spreadsheets, sticky notes, and various apps, leading to missed deadlines, inconsistent posting, and lack of strategic overview. Teams waste hours in meetings trying to coordinate content, and there's no central view of what's being published when and where.

### Solution
A visual, collaborative content calendar planner with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that makes content planning as easy as moving cards on a board. The tool provides a unified view of all content across all platforms, enables team collaboration, suggests optimal posting times, and integrates with major publishing platforms for seamless workflow from planning to publication.

### Target Audience
- Content marketing teams in SMBs
- Social media managers
- Digital marketing agencies
- Solo content creators and influencers
- Editorial teams at online publications
- E-commerce content teams
- Non-profit communications teams

### Value Proposition
"Plan your content visually, publish everywhere seamlessly. See your entire content strategy at a glance, collaborate with your team in real-time, and never miss a publishing deadline again. From idea to publication, all in one beautiful, intuitive platform."
