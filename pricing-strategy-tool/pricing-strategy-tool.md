# Pricing Strategy Tool - Implementation Plan

## Overview

### Problem
E-commerce businesses struggle to find the optimal pricing sweet spot. They either price too high and lose sales, or too low and leave money on the table. Manual competitor monitoring is time-consuming, and most businesses lack data-driven insights to make informed pricing decisions. Dynamic pricing strategies used by large retailers are inaccessible to smaller businesses.

### Solution
An intelligent pricing optimization platform that automatically monitors competitor prices, analyzes market trends, and provides actionable pricing recommendations. The tool uses machine learning to suggest optimal prices based on demand, competition, inventory levels, and profit margins, making enterprise-level pricing strategies accessible to all businesses.

### Target Audience
- E-commerce retailers ($50K-$50M revenue)
- Amazon sellers and multi-channel merchants
- Dropshipping businesses
- B2B wholesale companies
- Private label brands

### Value Proposition
"Increase profits by 15-30% with AI-powered pricing that monitors competitors 24/7 and automatically suggests the perfect price point. Stop guessing and start pricing with confidence using real-time market intelligence."
