# Social Media Contest Manager - Implementation Plan

## Overview

### Problem Statement
Running social media contests and giveaways is one of the most effective ways to grow audience and engagement, but managing them is a nightmare. Businesses struggle with tracking entries across multiple platforms, verifying participant actions, selecting random winners fairly, and ensuring compliance with platform rules and legal requirements.
