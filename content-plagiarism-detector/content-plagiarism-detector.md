# Content Plagiarism Detector - Implementation Plan

## Overview

### Problem Statement
Content creators invest significant time and effort creating original content, only to have it stolen and republished without attribution. This theft impacts SEO rankings, monetization opportunities, and brand reputation. Existing plagiarism tools focus on checking your content against others, not monitoring when others steal from you.

### Solution
Content Plagiarism Detector is a reverse plagiarism monitoring tool that continuously scans the web for unauthorized copies of your content. It alerts you when your content is stolen, provides evidence for DMCA takedowns, and helps protect your intellectual property through automated monitoring and enforcement assistance.

### Target Audience
- Professional bloggers protecting their content
- Digital publishers and media companies
- Course creators and educators
- E-book authors and writers
- Photography and creative professionals

### Value Proposition
"Protect your content automatically. Get instant alerts when someone steals your work and take action with one-click DMCA tools."
