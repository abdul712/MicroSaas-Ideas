# Business Health Dashboard

**The Fitbit for Your Business** - A comprehensive SaaS platform for real-time business health monitoring and analytics.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Business Health Dashboard is a production-ready SaaS application that provides real-time business health analytics with AI-powered insights. It serves as a comprehensive monitoring system that tracks key business metrics across 5 categories and provides a unified health score (0-100) with actionable recommendations.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Health Scoring**: Comprehensive 0-100 health score across Financial, Customer, Operational, Growth, and Risk categories
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection and predictive analytics
- **Smart Alert System**: Intelligent early warning system with customizable severity levels
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Enterprise-grade security with row-level security (RLS) and data isolation
- **External Integrations**: OAuth 2.0 framework supporting 12+ business tools (QuickBooks, Stripe, Shopify, etc.)
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive PWA-ready interface optimized for all devices
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live dashboards with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for instant updates

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- Framer Motion for animations
- TanStack Query for state management
- Chart.js + Observable Plot for visualizations

**Backend:**
- FastAPI (Python 3.11+) with async/await
- PostgreSQL 15 + TimescaleDB for time-series data
- Redis for caching and real-time features
- Celery for background job processing
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker containerization
- AWS ECS for deployment
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- DataDog for monitoring

### Database Schema

The application uses a multi-tenant architecture with the following core models:

- **Organizations**: Tenant isolation with plan-based features
- **Users**: Role-based access control with MFA support
- **BusinessMetrics**: Time-series metrics storage (TimescaleDB hypertable)
- **HealthScores**: Calculated health scores with insights
- **Alerts**: Intelligent alerting system with escalation
- **Integrations**: External API connection management

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm 8+
- Python 3.11+

- Redis 6+
- Docker (optional)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdul712/MicroSaas-Ideas.git
   cd MicroSaas-Ideas/business-health-dashboard-app
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Configure environment variables

   ```

4. **Access the Application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/docs
   - API Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health

### Docker Setup (Alternative)

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

## üìä Health Score Algorithm

The health score is calculated using a weighted average across 5 categories:

- **Financial Health (25%)**: Revenue, cash flow, burn rate, profit margins
- **Customer Health (25%)**: CAC, LTV, churn rate, NPS scores
- **Operational Health (20%)**: Productivity, uptime, support metrics
- **Growth Health (20%)**: Market expansion, product development, conversions
- **Risk Assessment (10%)**: Financial risk, market risk, compliance status

### Example Calculation

```python
overall_score = (
    financial_score * 0.25 +
    customer_score * 0.25 +
    operational_score * 0.20 +
    growth_score * 0.20 +
    (100 - risk_score) * 0.10  # Risk is inverted
)
```

## üîå Integrations

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | Data Types | Real-time | Webhooks |
|----------|------------|-----------|----------|

### OAuth 2.0 Flow

1. User initiates connection to external service
2. Redirect to provider's OAuth authorization endpoint
3. User grants permissions and returns with authorization code
4. Exchange code for access and refresh tokens
5. Store encrypted tokens and begin data synchronization
