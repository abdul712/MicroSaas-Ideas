# Customer Win-back Campaigns - Implementation Plan

## Overview

### Problem
E-commerce businesses lose 10-30% of customers annually, yet acquiring new customers costs 5x more than retaining existing ones. Most businesses focus heavily on new customer acquisition while ignoring the goldmine of dormant customers who already know and have purchased from their brand. Manual win-back efforts are inconsistent and lack personalization.

### Solution
An automated customer win-back platform that identifies dormant customers, creates personalized re-engagement campaigns, and uses AI to optimize timing, messaging, and offers. The system segments lapsed customers based on purchase history and behavior, then deploys multi-channel campaigns to bring them back profitably.

### Target Audience
- E-commerce stores with 1,000+ customers
- Subscription-based businesses
- B2C brands with repeat purchase potential
- Online service providers
- Digital product companies

### Value Proposition
"Win back 15-25% of dormant customers with AI-powered campaigns that know exactly when, what, and how to communicate. Turn your inactive customer database into a predictable revenue stream with personalized re-engagement on autopilot."
