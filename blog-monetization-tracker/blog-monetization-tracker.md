# Blog Monetization Tracker - Implementation Plan

## Overview

### Problem Statement
Bloggers and content creators struggle to track their various income streams across multiple platforms. They manually compile data from affiliate networks, ad platforms, sponsorship deals, and product sales, often missing optimization opportunities and tax deductions. This fragmented approach makes it difficult to understand which content generates the most revenue and where to focus efforts.

### Solution

It offers actionable insights to maximize blog revenue through data-driven decisions.

### Target Audience

- Niche site owners optimizing for revenue
