# Abandoned Cart Recovery - Implementation Plan

## Overview

### Problem
E-commerce businesses lose approximately 70% of potential sales due to cart abandonment. Customers add items to their shopping carts but leave without completing the purchase, resulting in billions in lost revenue annually. Most small to medium-sized online stores lack the resources or technical expertise to implement sophisticated cart recovery systems.

### Solution
An automated email sequence platform specifically designed for cart abandonment recovery. The system tracks abandoned carts, triggers personalized email campaigns, and provides analytics to optimize recovery rates. It integrates seamlessly with popular e-commerce platforms and requires no technical knowledge to set up and manage.

### Target Audience
- Small to medium-sized e-commerce businesses ($100K-$10M annual revenue)
- Online store owners using Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, or similar platforms
- Digital marketing agencies managing multiple e-commerce clients
- Dropshipping businesses and online retailers

### Value Proposition
