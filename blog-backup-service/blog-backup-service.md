# Blog Backup Service - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem
Bloggers invest years creating valuable content, but most don't have reliable backups. They risk losing everything due to hosting failures, hacking attempts, accidental deletions, or platform shutdowns. Current backup solutions are either too technical, too expensive, or unreliable. Many bloggers only realize they need backups after experiencing data loss, when it's too late.

### Solution
A simple, automated blog backup service that runs daily without any technical knowledge required. The service automatically backs up all blog content, images, comments, and settings to secure cloud storage. Users can restore their entire blog or specific posts with one click, access their content even if their blog goes down, and export their data in multiple formats.

### Target Audience
- WordPress bloggers (self-hosted and WordPress.com)
- Small business owners with blogs
- Professional bloggers and content creators
- Digital agencies managing multiple blogs
- Newsletter writers wanting archives
- Anyone who values their written content

### Value Proposition
"Never lose a single blog post again. Automatic daily backups of your entire blog—posts, images, comments, everything—stored securely in the cloud. One-click restore when you need it. Peace of mind for the price of a coffee per month."
