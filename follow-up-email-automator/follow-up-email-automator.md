### Target Audience
- Small to medium-sized B2B companies
- Sales teams (2-50 members)

## Implementation Tips for Non-Technical Founders

1. **Start with No-Code:** Use tools like Bubble.io or Webflow to create an MVP
2. **Hire Strategically:** Focus on a full-stack developer first
3. **Use Existing Infrastructure:** Leverage SendGrid/Mailgun instead of building email servers
4. **Focus on One Niche:** Start with a specific industry before expanding
5. **Validate Early:** Pre-sell before building the full product
6. **Document Everything:** Create SOPs for all processes from day one
7. **Prioritize Customer Success:** Happy customers are your best marketers

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for building a successful follow-up email automation platform. The key is to start simple, validate with real users, and iterate based on feedback while maintaining a focus on solving the core problem of consistent, effective follow-up.
