# Sales Performance Dashboard - Implementation Plan

## Overview

### Problem
E-commerce businesses struggle to get a clear, real-time picture of their sales performance across multiple channels. Data is scattered across different platforms, making it difficult to identify trends, spot opportunities, and make data-driven decisions quickly. Most analytics tools are either too complex or too basic, leaving a gap for actionable insights.

### Solution
A unified sales performance dashboard that aggregates data from all sales channels into beautiful, actionable visualizations. The platform provides real-time metrics, trend analysis, and predictive insights specifically designed for e-commerce businesses. It transforms raw data into clear action items that drive revenue growth.

- Small to medium online businesses

### Value Proposition
