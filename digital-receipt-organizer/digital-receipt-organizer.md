# Digital Receipt Organizer - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
Businesses struggle with receipt management for expense tracking, tax compliance, and reimbursements. Physical receipts fade, get lost, or pile up in boxes. Digital receipts scatter across emails and apps. During tax season or audits, finding specific receipts becomes a nightmare, potentially costing thousands in missed deductions or compliance issues.

### Solution
A Digital Receipt Organizer that uses OCR technology to automatically extract, categorize, and store receipt data. The platform turns receipt chaos into organized, searchable, IRS-compliant digital records with intelligent categorization and seamless integration with accounting software.

### Target Audience
- Small business owners and freelancers
- Accountants and bookkeepers
- Sales teams with expense reports
- Property managers tracking maintenance costs
- Restaurant and retail businesses
- Anyone needing expense documentation

### Value Proposition
"Never lose a receipt again. Snap, scan, or forward receipts to automatically extract data, categorize expenses, and maintain IRS-compliant records. Save 10+ hours monthly on expense tracking and maximize tax deductions."
