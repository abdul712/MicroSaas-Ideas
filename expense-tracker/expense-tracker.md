# Expense Tracker - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
Small business owners and freelancers waste hours manually tracking expenses, often losing receipts and missing tax deductions. Traditional expense management software is complex and expensive, designed for large enterprises. This results in poor financial visibility, missed deductions worth thousands of dollars, and stressful tax seasons.

### Solution
An AI-powered expense tracker that uses OCR technology to instantly scan and categorize receipts via mobile photo capture. The platform automatically extracts data, categorizes expenses, and provides real-time spending insights with minimal user input.

### Target Audience
- Small business owners (1-10 employees)
- Freelancers and independent contractors
- Real estate agents and property managers
- Sales professionals with expense accounts
- Digital nomads and remote workers

### Value Proposition
"Snap a photo of any receipt and let AI handle the rest - track expenses in seconds, never lose a receipt again, and maximize your tax deductions with intelligent categorization and real-time insights."
