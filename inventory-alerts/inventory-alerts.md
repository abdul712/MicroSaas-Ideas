# Inventory Alerts - Implementation Plan

## Overview

### Problem
Stockouts cost e-commerce businesses 4% of annual revenue on average, while excess inventory ties up capital and increases storage costs. Small to medium businesses often rely on manual inventory checks or basic spreadsheets, leading to missed reorder points, emergency shipping costs, and dissatisfied customers when popular items are unavailable.

### Solution
An intelligent inventory monitoring system that tracks stock levels across multiple channels, predicts optimal reorder points using AI, and sends automated alerts before stockouts occur. The platform integrates with existing inventory systems and provides actionable insights to maintain optimal stock levels while minimizing carrying costs.

### Target Audience
- E-commerce retailers with 50-5,000 SKUs
- Multi-channel sellers (online + retail)
- Amazon FBA sellers
- Wholesale distributors
- Direct-to-consumer brands

### Value Proposition
"Never run out of your best sellers again. Our AI-powered inventory alerts predict exactly when to reorder, considering seasonality, trends, and lead times. Reduce stockouts by 85% while cutting excess inventory by 30%."
