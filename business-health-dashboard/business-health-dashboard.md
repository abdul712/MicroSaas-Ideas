# Business Health Dashboard - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem
Small business owners are drowning in data from multiple sources but lack a unified view of their business health. They struggle to identify problems early, miss growth opportunities, and make decisions based on incomplete information scattered across various tools and spreadsheets.

### Value Proposition
"Your business vital signs at a glance. Our health dashboard monitors all aspects of your business 24/7, alerting you to problems before they hurt your bottom line and highlighting opportunities to grow – all in one simple screen that takes seconds to understand."
