# Local Business Directory - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
Local businesses struggle to get discovered online while consumers have difficulty finding trusted, specialized services in their area. Generic directories like Google and Yelp are oversaturated, making it hard for niche businesses to stand out. Specialized communities (pet services, wedding vendors, home services) lack dedicated platforms that understand their unique needs, resulting in missed connections between quality local providers and customers actively seeking their services.

### Solution
A niche-specific Local Business Directory platform that creates focused marketplaces for specialized business categories. The platform provides enhanced profiles, verified reviews, booking capabilities, and community features tailored to specific industries. By focusing on one niche at a time, the directory becomes the go-to resource for both businesses and consumers in that specialty.
