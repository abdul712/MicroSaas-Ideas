# A/B Test Manager - Implementation Plan

## Overview

### Problem
E-commerce businesses leave money on the table by not optimizing their conversion rates. While large companies have dedicated teams and expensive tools for A/B testing, small to medium businesses lack accessible solutions. They rely on gut feelings rather than data, missing opportunities to increase revenue by 20-30% through simple optimizations.

### Solution
A simple, affordable A/B testing platform specifically designed for e-commerce product pages. The tool enables non-technical users to create, run, and analyze split tests without coding knowledge. It focuses on the highest-impact elements like headlines, images, pricing, and CTAs, providing clear statistical insights and revenue impact calculations.

### Target Audience
- Small to medium e-commerce stores
- Shopify and WooCommerce merchants
- Digital marketers without technical skills
- Conversion rate optimization agencies
- Direct-to-consumer brands

### Value Proposition
"Double your conversion rate with simple A/B tests that anyone can create in minutes. No coding required, see results in days not weeks, and know exactly how much extra revenue each test generates. Built specifically for e-commerce success."
