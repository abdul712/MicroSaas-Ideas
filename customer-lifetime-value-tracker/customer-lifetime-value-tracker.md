# Customer Lifetime Value Tracker - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem
Small businesses struggle to understand the long-term value of their customers, making it difficult to make informed decisions about marketing spend, customer retention efforts, and pricing strategies. Without CLV insights, they risk overspending on low-value customer acquisition or underinvesting in high-value customer retention.

### Solution
A simple yet powerful Customer Lifetime Value tracking tool that automatically calculates, predicts, and visualizes CLV across different customer segments, helping businesses make data-driven decisions about customer acquisition costs, retention strategies, and revenue optimization.

### Target Audience
- E-commerce store owners
- SaaS companies
- Subscription box services
- Online course creators
- Membership site operators
- Small retail businesses
- Service-based businesses
- B2B companies with recurring customers

### Value Proposition
"Know what every customer is really worth. Our CLV tracker reveals which customers drive your profits, predicts future value, and shows exactly where to invest your marketing dollars for maximum return â€“ all automated and easy to understand."
