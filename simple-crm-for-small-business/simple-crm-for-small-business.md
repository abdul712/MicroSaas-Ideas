# Simple CRM for Small Business - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
Small businesses often struggle with customer relationship management due to the complexity and cost of traditional CRM systems. Many resort to spreadsheets, sticky notes, or disconnected tools, leading to lost opportunities, poor customer service, and inefficient sales processes. Enterprise CRM solutions like Salesforce are overwhelming and expensive for businesses with 1-50 employees.

### Solution
A streamlined, user-friendly CRM specifically designed for small businesses that focuses on essential features without unnecessary complexity. The solution emphasizes quick setup (under 5 minutes), intuitive interface, and core functionality that small businesses actually need.

### Target Audience
- Small business owners (1-20 employees)
- Freelancers and consultants
- Local service businesses (plumbers, electricians, contractors)
- Small retail shops
- Professional services (accountants, lawyers, real estate agents)
- Startups and solopreneurs

### Value Proposition
"Manage your customers in minutes, not hours. Simple CRM gives you everything you need to track customers, deals, and communications without the complexity of enterprise software. Set up in 5 minutes, use forever."
