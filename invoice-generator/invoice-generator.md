# Invoice Generator - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
Freelancers and small businesses struggle with creating professional invoices quickly and tracking payment statuses. Many resort to using generic templates or expensive accounting software that's overly complex for their needs. This leads to delayed payments, poor cash flow management, and unprofessional client interactions.
