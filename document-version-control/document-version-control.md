# Document Version Control - Implementation Plan

## Overview

### Problem
Businesses lose critical information and waste countless hours due to poor document version management. Teams work on outdated files, overwrite important changes, and struggle to track who changed what and when. Email chains with "Final_v3_REALLY_FINAL_2.docx" create chaos, compliance risks, and productivity losses.

### Solution
Document Version Control is a simple yet powerful version management system designed for business documents. Unlike complex developer tools like Git, it provides intuitive version tracking, visual diff comparisons, and rollback capabilities that any office worker can use without training.

### Target Audience
- Small to medium businesses (10-500 employees)
- Legal firms and contract managers
- Marketing teams and content creators
- Compliance and regulatory departments
- Remote teams collaborating on documents
- Consultancies and professional services

### Value Proposition
"Never lose another edit or waste time on document chaos. Track every change, compare versions instantly, and restore any previous version with one click. Document management that actually makes sense."
