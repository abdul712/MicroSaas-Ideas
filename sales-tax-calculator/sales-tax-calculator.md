# Sales Tax Calculator - Implementation Plan

## Overview

### Problem
E-commerce businesses face a compliance nightmare with sales tax across different states and jurisdictions. With over 12,000 tax jurisdictions in the US alone, each with different rates and rules, manual calculation is error-prone and time-consuming. Non-compliance can result in hefty penalties, audits, and legal issues.

### Solution
An automated sales tax calculation and compliance platform that integrates with e-commerce systems to provide real-time, accurate tax calculations. The system handles nexus determination, rate updates, exemption certificates, and filing reminders, making tax compliance simple and worry-free for online sellers.

### Target Audience
- E-commerce businesses selling across state lines
- Amazon FBA sellers
- Shopify and WooCommerce store owners
- Multi-channel retailers
- Digital product sellers

### Value Proposition
"Never worry about sales tax again. Our automated calculator ensures 100% accurate tax collection across all jurisdictions, tracks your nexus obligations, and reminds you when to file. Stay compliant without the complexity."
