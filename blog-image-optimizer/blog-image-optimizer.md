# Blog Image Optimizer - Implementation Plan

## Overview

### Problem Statement
Bloggers unknowingly upload massive image files that slow down their sites, hurting user experience and SEO rankings. They lack the technical knowledge to properly optimize images and find existing tools either too complex or requiring manual work for each image. This results in slower load times, higher hosting costs, and lost visitors who abandon slow-loading pages.

### Solution
Blog Image Optimizer is an automatic image optimization service that works seamlessly with any blog platform. It automatically compresses, resizes, and converts images to modern formats while maintaining visual quality. The tool requires zero technical knowledge and works in the background to keep blogs fast and images beautiful.

- Food bloggers needing high-quality visuals
