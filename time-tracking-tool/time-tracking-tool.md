# Time Tracking Tool - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement
Freelancers, consultants, and agencies struggle to accurately track billable hours across multiple projects and clients. Manual time tracking leads to lost revenue from unbilled hours, disputes over invoices, and inability to analyze profitability. Existing solutions are either too complex for small teams or lack essential features like automatic tracking and client billing integration.

### Solution
An intelligent time tracking tool that combines automatic time capture with manual tracking options, providing seamless integration between time tracking and client billing. The platform uses smart detection to identify work patterns, reminds users to track time, and generates detailed timesheets that convert directly into client invoices.

### Target Audience
- Freelancers (developers, designers, writers, consultants)
- Small agencies (2-20 employees)
- Law firms and accounting practices
- Digital marketing agencies
- Remote teams and contractors

### Value Proposition
"Never lose another billable hour - automatically track time across all your projects, generate accurate client reports in seconds, and increase your revenue by 20% with intelligent time capture and seamless billing integration."
